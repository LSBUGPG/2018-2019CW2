Package number 3 has begun,as I now tackle the creation of a minimap.
The script was not that much of a trouble, thank you youtube, what took some time was to make the canvas, use 2 images, one as a white background for the image that is named 'Minimap', added a new camera for the top view that would become the minimap and added a new asset called the render texture, which ties it all nicely
