Final package for the cousework, and I have decided to make an enemy spawner that uses the Ai chase from package 2

Scripting the spawner was interesting, as there are lots of ways to do it, the one thing that i want to remember from this is the 'WaitForSeconds' function, that can come in handy for future projects
