Explanation of game
the final game is about running away from a giant red wall that is chasing the player, if the player or the players balls
comes into contect with the following object then the player will be spawned into the failure room, you need to restart
the game in order to try again. to win the player has to get through the path, green blocks can be destroyed by balls,
which the player can spawn with space, red blocks cannot be destroyed so you must go around them. the player must make sure that they 
push their own balls off the map by walking into them due to the fact that if the players balls comes into contact with the 
red wall then it will still teleport them to the failure room, once the player makes their way through the path to the end they must 
fall down onto the purple platform where they will respawn in the victory room to show that they have successfully completed the challenge.
